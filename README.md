## General Information

It is a race against time to beat the competition to market to build a portfolio management system for many assets including crypto.  With the multiple crypto-assets available and the keys needed one needs a "universal" wallet to efficiently and securely manage these addresses.  Using hd-wallet-derive supporting BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44 along with Python will help manage the scripts to bring everything together.  You will find in this repository a tool to begin managing many addresses securely.  At this time, there are only two coins working, Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet, but feel free to fork the project and continue further to add coins as needed.[1]
